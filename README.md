# Poor Man's Eyetracker
This is the overview page for our paper _Revising Poor Man's Eye Tracker For Crowd-Sourced Studies_.

During our work, we developed two tools. One for conducting the crowd-sourced study, and one for visualizing and evaluating its findings.
You can find the source code for both tools in the following repositories:

* Pipemaze Study: https://github.com/vs-ude/pipemaze-study
* Pipemaze Visualizer: https://github.com/vs-ude/pipemaze-visualizer
